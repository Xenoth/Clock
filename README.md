# Clockuino
Clockuino is clock app for Gamebuino, a cheap console made with Arduino.<br>
It does works pretty well actualy, but still need some improvement.

## Use
Gamebuino Hardware : http://gamebuino.com/<br>
Gamebuino library : https://github.com/Rodot/Gamebuino

## Requirement
It requires a DS3231 I2C Module to run, code for this clock module is DS3231.h and DS3231.cpp.<br>
Of course it also requires a Gamebuino.

## Future
Have to finish the DS3231's classes and the main code to provides a full app.
